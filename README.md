## Development

To install the **development pre-requisites**, please follow the instructions in the links below:

- [Python 3.8](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [Poetry](https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry#installation)

### Installing development dependencies

First, change your current working directory to the project's root directory and bootstrap the project:

```bash
# change current working directory
$ cd <path/to/cs-data-ingestion>

# bootstraps development and project dependencies
$ make bootstrap
```

>_**NOTE**: By default, [poetry creates and manages virtual environments to install project dependencies](https://python-poetry.org/docs/basic-usage/#using-your-virtual-environment) -- meaning that it will work isolated from your global Python installation. This avoids conflicts with other packages installed in your system._
